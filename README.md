# GC-NewVisitAll
TamperMonkey Code to restore the "Visit All" functionality related to trackables on Geocaching.com

On July 23, 2025, Geocaching.com announced via the Community forums that the "Visit All" functionality was removed when logging visits of Geocaching Trackables on cache visits. (https://forums.geocaching.com/GC/index.php?/topic/425855-release-notes-website-trackable-inventory-on-cache-logs-july-23-2025/) While the possibility of manually selecting which trackables a player wants to visit a cache site still exists, the blanket option known as "Visit All" which automatically set all trackables was disabled/removed.

This script is an attempt to restore the functionality of the "Visit All" button while submitting cache logs.
